What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Creates the hidden .git file
- No commits are created
- No files are put in the repository (yet)
- Need to do it to set up the initial .git and to start off your top directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?
- Does not contain all files (necessarily) in the working directory
- Contains files you plan to commit but haven't yet
- Able to make changes before committing
- Able to have extra files in the working directory that aren't in the repository
