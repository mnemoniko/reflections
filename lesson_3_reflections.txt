When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To share with other collaborators
- To publish code or code snapshots/versions
- To backup changes you made locally

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Collaborators might push code to the repository that is incompatible with yours
- If you are making local changes, a remote pull would overwrite them
